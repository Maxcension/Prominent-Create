# Prominent Create

The sole reason this exists is because there is no available version in CurseForge fo Create 1.20.1 Fabric which works with Sodium 0.5+. Performance is an essential part of Prominence, and after waiting a long time for a fix which never came out, this is a temporary solution in the meantime.
